# oa

This is my OA submission. Here is the link to the repo [https://github.com/mikeli0623/oa](https://github.com/mikeli0623/oa). The website itself is fairly simple. It is a single page app that mimics a blog for recipes to be shared by users. Most of the functionality of the site has not been implemented. The recipes were also randomly generated and nonsensical. I made two API endpoints: one that gets all recipes (with an additional query to get the most popular recipes) and the second gets a specific recipe based on a primary key.
